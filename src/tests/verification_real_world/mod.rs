//! Certificate verification tests that use real-world certificates and the
//! "real" (non-mock) Rustls configuration returned.
//!
//! # Repeatability and Self-containedness
//!
//! These tests are written to reduce the time-bomb nature of testing with
//! real certificates, which expire and/or can be revoked over time. For
//! example, rather than connecting to the TLS server over the network,
//! these tests operate on a locally-cached copy of the certificates
//! downloaded at a point in time. However, there are some inherent
//! limitations of what we can do when using real-world certificates. We
//! accept that the benefit of having these tests outweigh this downside.
//! If we encounter cases where these tests are flaky we'll spend additional
//! effort  
//!
//! * If these certificates are ever revoked then it is possible that, even if
//! with the measures mentioned in the next paragraphs, the operating system
//! might learn of the revocation externally and cause the tests to fail.
//!
//! * Some operating systems, Windows in particular, download the set of
//! trusted roots dynamically as-needed. If there is a failure during that
//! fetching then the trust anchors for these certificates might not be
//! trusted by the operating system's root store.
//!
//! XXX: Currently these tests are a time-bomb because they validate the
//! certificates as of the current system time, because the version of
//! Rustls we use does not support passing in a different time. The newest
//! version of Rustls does have that capability. We need to upgrade to that
//! version of Rustls, and/or otherwise change these tests, before these
//! certificates expire in Fall/Winter 2022.
//!
//! XXX: These tests should be using a stapled OCSP responses so that the
//! (operating-system-based) verifier doesn't try to fetch an OCSP
//! response or CRL certificate. However, until we can fix the validation
//! at a specific point in time, we can't do this, as the OCSP responses
//! will generally expire within a matter of days of being produced. Also,
//! we'd need to upgrade to a version of Rustls that supports passing in
//! stapled OCSP responses for each certificate in the chain. Most certificate
//! verifiers that do fetching of OCSP responses will "fail open"; that is, if
//! a networking error causes the fetch of the OCSP response to fail, then
//! they will continue roughly as though they received a "Good" response.
//! Thus we don't expect these tests to be flaky w.r.t. that, except for
//! potentially poor performance.
